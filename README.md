QTM2000 Fall 2018 Final Group Project
- **QTM 2000:** Case Studies in Business Analytics
- **Contributors:** Yimeng (Silvia) Huang, Haorui (Raymond) Huang, Jiayan (Shirley) Ying, Xianle Jin
- **Note:** In this Github repo, I will only include my own portion of code and any code necessary for cleaning and exploring the data before building models. Future students should not copy the project as their own to submit for QTM2000 Final Project.


## Project Description:
Students are expected to complete a data analysis/machine learning project from scratch that addresses a business problem.
- They are asked to define their own business problem of interest and search for their own dataset for analyses. The dataset cannot be overly analyzed before (e.g. datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle competitions, etc.).
- For data analysis/machine learning, they should clean the dataset, explore the variables, and build their own machine learning models.
- In the end, they should draw conclusions and insights from their analyses to make recommendations.
- Deliverables: in-class presentation, written report


## Dataset Description:
The two raw datasets used in our project were obtained from *The Open PV Project* (no longer available) of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (https://www.nrel.gov/pv/open-pv-project.html) in November 2018.
- **full Open PV Dataset:** 1,020,813 records, 81 variables
- **Tracking the Sun Public Data File** (https://emp.lbl.gov/tracking-the-sun): 1,094,909 records, 52 variables (collected and processed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory based on the full dataset)
- **Note:** The datasets on the website were already updated as of 1/31/2021. In this Github repo, I will not include the original datasets (.csv) we used in the project due to copyright considerations. If anyone is interested, please DM me to discuss privately.
